## What is this?
A Minecraft **Datapack** - basically something you can install onto **vanilla worlds** to change the game.
## What does it do?
Makes **phantoms spawn when you sleep**, forcing players to **make a proper shelter** (otherwise you get woken up and attacked in the middle of the night)

Useful for **modpack authors** or **players** who want to balance beds more so that you can't just plop a bed down in the middle of nowhere and skip the night.
## How do I use it?
When creating a new world, you can **add datapacks through the menu**.
## Can I install it as a mod?
~~Sure, check the **Modrinth page** for downloads. This will make it install for **every world** instead of just whatever you put it in.~~
Modrinth page currently does not exist - TO BE UPDATED
## Safe to uninstall?
Yup! Just get **take it out of your datapack folder** and it will stop spawning phantoms!
