## What is this?
A Minecraft **Datapack** - basically something you can install onto **vanilla worlds** to change the game.
## What does it do?
Makes **phantoms spawn when you sleep**, forcing players to **make a proper shelter** (otherwise you get woken up and attacked in the middle of the night)
Useful for **modpack authors** or **players** who want to balance beds more so that you can't just plop a bed down in the middle of nowhere and skip the night.
